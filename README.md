Solar tracker is a device designed to increase the efficiency of solar energy harvesting by tracking the sun's movement throughout the day. It is typically composed of two servo motors, an Arduino microcontroller, and LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensors.  The servo motors are responsible for moving the solar panel to follow the sun's movement. The LDR sensors are used to detect the sun's position in the sky, and the Arduino processes the sensor data to determine the optimal position for the solar panel.

The solar tracker works by constantly monitoring the LDR sensors to determine the direction of the brightest light. The Arduino microcontroller then sends signals to the servo motors, which move the solar panel in the direction of the brightest light. By continuously adjusting the solar panel's angle, the solar tracker can ensure that it is always facing the sun, maximizing the amount of energy it can harvest.
